# Stock Market Data - Exploratory Data Analysis Report

## Dataset Overview

### Key Statistics
- **Total Records**: 34,646,258 rows
- **Date Range**: January 2, 1962 to November 4, 2024 (62+ years of data)
- **File Sizes**: 
  - Parquet: 0.90 GB (recommended for analysis)
  - CSV: 3.27 GB
- **Number of Tickers**: Approximately 9,000 (as indicated by dataset name)

### Data Structure
The dataset contains 9 columns with the following structure:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Date | object | Trading date |
| Ticker | object | Stock symbol |
| Open | float64 | Opening price |
| High | float64 | Highest price of the day |
| Low | float64 | Lowest price of the day |
| Close | float64 | Closing price |
| Volume | float64 | Trading volume |
| Dividends | float64 | Dividend payments |
| Stock Splits | float64 | Stock split information |

## Key Findings from Sample Analysis

### 1. Data Quality
- **No missing values** in price columns (Open, High, Low, Close)
- **Minimal zero volume days** (0.06% in sample)
- Data appears to be **split-adjusted** based on the presence of fractional prices in early years

### 2. Price Characteristics
- **Price Range**: From $0.002 to $2.73 in the sample
- **Distribution**: Wide range of price levels across different stocks and time periods
- **Historical Data**: Sample shows data from 1962, indicating comprehensive historical coverage

### 3. Volume Patterns
- **Average Volume**: ~460,670 shares per day in sample
- **Volume Range**: 0 to 19.5 million shares
- **Distribution**: Highly skewed with most days having lower volume

### 4. Ticker Coverage
- Sample contains 30 unique tickers including major companies:
  - **Blue Chips**: IBM, GE, JNJ, MMM, DIS, PG
  - **Energy**: CVX, BP
  - **Industrial**: CAT, BA, HON, GD
  - **Utilities**: ED, AEP, DTE, CNP

## Data Quality Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 62+ years of historical data
2. **Large Scale**: 34+ million records across ~9,000 tickers
3. **Clean Data**: No missing values in critical price columns
4. **Adjusted Prices**: Data appears to be split/dividend adjusted
5. **Multiple Formats**: Available in both CSV and Parquet formats

### Potential Considerations
1. **Open Price Anomaly**: Many records show Open = 0.0, which may indicate:
   - Data collection methodology differences
   - Historical data limitations for older records
   - Need for data preprocessing

2. **Volume Variations**: Some stocks show zero volume days (though minimal)

3. **Price Scale**: Historical prices are very low, confirming split-adjusted data

## Implications for Stock Price Prediction Model

### 1. Data Preprocessing Needs
- Handle Open = 0.0 cases (use previous close or High/Low average)
- Create technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD)
- Normalize prices for different time periods and stocks
- Handle stock splits and dividend adjustments

### 2. Feature Engineering Opportunities
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages
- **Volume Indicators**: Volume moving averages, volume spikes
- **Price Patterns**: Support/resistance levels, breakouts
- **Volatility Measures**: Historical volatility, price ranges

### 3. Model Architecture Considerations
- **Time Series Nature**: LSTM/GRU networks for sequential patterns
- **Multi-Stock Modeling**: Consider cross-stock correlations
- **Regime Changes**: Account for different market periods (bull/bear markets)
- **Scale Differences**: Normalize across different price levels and time periods

## Next Steps for Current Events Integration

### 1. News Data Sources
- **Financial News APIs**: Alpha Vantage, NewsAPI, Bloomberg API
- **Economic Indicators**: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- **Earnings Data**: Company earnings announcements and results
- **Market Events**: IPOs, mergers, regulatory changes

### 2. Event Classification Framework
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive, negative, neutral news sentiment
- **Event Types**: Earnings, mergers, regulatory, economic indicators
- **Impact Scope**: Company-specific, sector-wide, market-wide
- **Temporal Alignment**: Match news timestamps with trading data

### 3. Feature Integration Strategy
- **Lag Features**: News impact may have delayed effects
- **Aggregation Windows**: Daily, weekly news sentiment scores
- **Sector Mapping**: Group news by industry sectors
- **Market Regime Indicators**: Bull/bear market classifications

## Recommended Model Development Approach

### Phase 1: Baseline Models
1. **Simple Technical Models**: Moving average crossovers, momentum indicators
2. **Linear Models**: Ridge/Lasso regression with technical features
3. **Tree-Based Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost with engineered features

### Phase 2: Advanced Time Series Models
1. **ARIMA/SARIMA**: Traditional time series forecasting
2. **LSTM/GRU**: Deep learning for sequential patterns
3. **Transformer Models**: Attention-based architectures

### Phase 3: News-Integrated Models
1. **Sentiment-Enhanced Models**: Combine technical + sentiment features
2. **Multi-Modal Architecture**: Separate networks for price and news data
3. **Event-Driven Models**: Focus on specific event types and their impacts

## Visualization Insights

The generated plots in `eda_plots/` directory show:

1. **Price Distributions**: Wide range of price levels across the dataset
2. **Sample Time Series**: Clear trends and patterns in individual stocks
3. **Volume Analysis**: Typical trading volume patterns with occasional spikes

This comprehensive dataset provides an excellent foundation for building sophisticated stock price prediction models that can incorporate both technical analysis and current events impact assessment.
